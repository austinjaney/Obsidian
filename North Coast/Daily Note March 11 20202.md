Marty has given me the go ahead to enable Office 365 licensing across the board. I have now done so.

Sent an email out about trello accounts

"Hello Team!

I wanted to clarify what’s happening with Trello.

This is not the result of something we did but rather something Atlassian (the creators of Trello) is doing.  We have had a corporate Atlassian account for quite some time but have never setup or offered Trello for Business. Atlassian has made the decision that If your account email ends in northcoastchurch.com then it is property of your organization and not yours individually and that if employees of North Coast Church are using Trello at work then North Coast should pay for those employees to have Atlassian account logins.  As a result of Atlassian's policy change they are migrating all individual Trello accounts to become managed accounts under our existing corporate Atlassian account, since Atlassian respects your privacy they are offering everyone two options.

1. Do nothing, once Atlassian has completed their migration you will be redirected to a new log on page where you will use your northcoastchurch.com email and current email password to login to your Trello account.  There may be additional steps needed after first logon to keep your account secure.  Once complete you can continue to use Trello in its free tier capacity and all your data will remain intact. If you were perviously paying for Trello personal you will probably loose that subscription as the only option would be for North Coast to buy a business subscription for those that need premium features.

OR

2. Change your Trello account information to your personal email address, doing this will let Atlassian know that this is not an account you use for work at NorthCoast.  If you have a lot of personal data in Trello this might be a better option.

In general a lot of cloud companies are moving in this direction, IT has never recommended signing up personal cloud services or subscriptions with your @northcoastchurch.com email address, we would ask that you use your church email account for ministry related communication and needs exclusively.

For additional details about what’s happening with Trello accounts please see what Atlassian has to say here: https://help.trello.com/article/1186-managed-atlassian-accounts-for-trello#new1

As always if your ministry has IT related needs (computer, cloud services, software, etc) we would ask that you coordinate with IT so we can meet those needs and provide support.  We are happy to provide any assistance that you might need during Atlassian's transition.
