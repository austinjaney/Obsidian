# RFC1 North Coast IT Team Documentation
#docs #proposed

## Scope of Standard
The scope of this standards document is to give a common format and framework for organizing the collective knowledge of the IT Team. This standard applies to: Knowledge base articles, Guides, Documentation, and Notes. 

## Document Formatting by Line
1. Line 1: H1 Heading, will be the same as the note name. H1 headings are only ever used 1 time in the document and always at line 1.
2. Line 2: Tags, All Documents will be given fitting tags on line 2 (i.e. #docs #proposed )
3. Line 3: blank line
4. Line 4: Information of the note or a subheading (if multi heading document) will begin on line 4
5. All remaining lines follow an outline structure.

## Misc Rules
1. [Github flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) will be the specification. 
2. When code blocks are used a tag will be used for the language of the code block. (i.e if in the doc there is a PowerShell code block it will be tagged #powershell )
3. Code, Scripts, Commands, and configuration files are always represented as code blocks.

## Storage
1. We will use our teams store to store and sync all notes 
2. technicians are able to choose what markdown editor they preffer as long as it does not alter the format of the notes, add metadata to files, or automaticaly change the orginization of our teams store.
3.
