# Install SNMP from Powershell
#sysadmin #windows #server 

Install SNMP Feature
```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature SNMP-Service
```

It looks like sometimes windows server does not add all the required SNMP RSAT tools which means some tabs donâ€™t appear in services.msc for the SNMP service to add those open command prompt as an admin and run

```powershell
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Server-RSAT-SNMP /ALL
```
