# Activating Windows from CMD
#sysadmin #cmd #powershell #windows

There seems to be a bug in server 2019 where you can only active windows with your key by using the command line like so.

```
C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk your-key-here
```

If you download a copy of server 2012r2 from Microsoft's eval center you can upgrade to a full copy of server 2012r2 standard. 
In powershell you will need to run the following commands:

```powershell
DISM /online /Get-CurrentEdition
```

Make note of the edition ID, in my case I was using server standard and it listed ServerStandardEval. ServerStandard is server standard.

```powershell
DISM /online /Set-Edition:ServerStandard /ProductKey:XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX /AcceptEula
```

> Replace ServerStandard with your desired edition and product key with the one you intend to use, windows will reboot and you should see that youâ€™re now running your desired version of windows server. You can now activate windows normally using the system and security system dialogue.
