## Email about Microsoft Teams

Hello Team!

Shortly we will begin to roll out Office 365 so that we as an orginization can begin coloberating in the cloud.

If you would like to be an early adopter now is the time! To get started head over to office.com and sign in with your existing North Coast email address and password. 

Once you do office.com will ask you to go and download the microsoft authenticator application on your smartphone to help keep your account secure and also ask for a personal email address and phone number which you will be able to use to reset your password if you get locked out.

As exciting as these new features are we would ask that at this time you explore microsoft teams and coordnate with IT as we setup your team in Office365.
