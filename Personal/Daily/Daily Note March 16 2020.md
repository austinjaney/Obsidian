Good Morning North Coast!

It is my pleasure to introduce the powerful tools offered Microsoft's Office 365, as of today you can now login at office.com using your current @northcoastchurch.com email address and password, once you do you will be asked to complete a couple security steps. 

Before you get started there are some things you need to know.

Before moving your teams data from the P drive or other network drives please talk to IT first!  We want to avoide duplicating your data and or causing confusion for your team members.

The tools we now have:

Microsoft Teams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKU-FMzZFF0
- Team chats (text, audio and video chats)
