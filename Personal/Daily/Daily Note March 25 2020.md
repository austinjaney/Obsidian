Had a conversation with marty about the dangers of doing a bare metal backups restore of active directory as described here in microsofts article about USN Rollback: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/875495/how-to-detect-and-recover-from-a-usn-rollback-in-windows-server-dc

I need to read more about this and review micrososfts guide for virtualizing domain controllers.
